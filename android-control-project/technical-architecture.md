# Technical Architecture for Android Device Control System

## Core Technologies

### 1. Device Communication Layer
- **ADB Integration**
  - Uses Android Debug Bridge for low-level device communication
  - Implemented with Node.js ADB wrapper libraries
  - Supports both USB and wireless connections
  - Handles device authentication and authorization

- **Device Protocol**
  - Custom protocol for efficient batch commands
  - Optimized for minimal bandwidth usage
  - Support for command prioritization
  - Heartbeat mechanism for connection monitoring

### 2. Application Framework
- **Electron Application Structure**
  ```

      ├── types/        # TypeScript types
      ├── constants/    # Shared constants
      └── utils/        # Shared utilities
  ```

- **State Management**
  - Redux for global state
  - Redux Toolkit for simplified state logic
  - Redux Saga for side effects
  - Persistent storage for configuration

### 3. Automation Engine
- **Appium Integration**
  - Custom Appium server management
  - Parallel session handling
  - Device-specific capability configuration
  - Element caching for performance

- **UI Interaction Scripts**
